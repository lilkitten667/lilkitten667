🔭       My almamater Currently is the amazing **Foothill College**. To be honest, they have
    kept me engaged and excited about my journey and have helped me with accomidations
    that if i had them over 20 years ago today would be a lot different. I am forever
    greatful they didn't because i enjoy it now having my experiences!!!



🌱     My degree path is **Compupter Science**, my career path **Pentesting, purple team unite**



👯     Ive been asked, "why so late for school?", or even told "You're making a mistake!!" and with
    those walking roosters I say, "well I am sorry your stagnent!!" 


🤔     Being raised around teachers I learned, *we are always learning and growing!!* That being said
    **I want all the help**, in that *I love input, I love it when people put their 2 cents in* I
    **CANNOT** stress this enough we don't just learn from, books, teachers and google!!!
    sometimes even a child can teach us something we didn't know stay grateful! 

💬    **Ask me about <----** *this can be quite dangerous,* 😳 🙊 For those of you that read 
    until here....  By all means ask!!the difference between a good and bad question? 
    the bad doesn't get asked. Be warned I will not sugar coat any answser, plus I am a 
    terrible lier. Object Permanence is areal issue with me. * **who else** has the the  **F' it wall?** *
